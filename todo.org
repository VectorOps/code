#+title: Code ToDo

* [ ] Graph
** [ ] Add a way to override values from a shared config. Options:
- Through special value
- Though path in the settings of <tool_name.node_name.field_name> syntax
- Both?
- Also read from files
** [X] Graph runner
- Async streaming
- Keeps track of current node
** [ ] Streamline node transition - if there's nowhere to proceed, do not ask for input with need_input
* [ ] Settings
** [ ] Settings loader
* [ ] Chat state
** [X] NodeLog, Section, Message
** [ ] Message construction helpers
* [ ] Nodes
** [ ] Think how to manage state for a run
- Sometimes we need to maintain the state when additional information is found and added to state
- Sometimes we need to start fresh
- But need to maintain state if looped by human
- Most likely make it a setting of a Node (explicit config). Via enum?
  - Always resets
  - Human resets
  - Never resets
- We need machinery to go back in time and reset graph execution to a specific history
** [X] Base node runner class
** [ ] LLM node
*** [X] Base
**** [X] Tool configuration
*** [ ] Dynamic output selection by LLM
*** [ ] Auto-retry on timeout
*** [ ] Auto-retry when throttled
** [ ] Fan-out node - call other defined tools, collect their results and pass concatenated messages to next tool
** [ ] TODO node
* [ ] Block parsers
** [ ] Code parsers
** [ ] Diff parsers
*** [ ] GPT diff format
*** [ ] Fenced diff format
*** [ ] Full file diff format
