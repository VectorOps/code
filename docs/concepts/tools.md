# Tools and executors

Tools give workflows the ability to interact with the outside world. They are
backed by executors that perform side effects such as applying patches,
running shell commands, or starting nested workflows.

Tool usage is configured per node and globally via settings so you can control
which capabilities are available and how they are approved.
