# VectorOps Code documentation

VectorOps Code is a graph-based orchestration layer for AI-assisted coding.

It turns development tasks into configurable workflows composed of nodes,
edges, tools, and approvals so you can keep control over how changes are
planned, applied, and reviewed.

## Highlights

- Agentic coding flows that plan, edit, review, and iterate
- Outcome-driven routing that adapts to success, retries, or errors
- Integrated tooling to apply changes, run commands, and launch nested tasks
- Interactive terminal experience with streaming output and approvals
- Model-agnostic LLM execution with tool-aware prompting and streaming
- Cost and token tracking to keep usage visible

For a high-level introduction, see the sections below and the README in the
repository root.
