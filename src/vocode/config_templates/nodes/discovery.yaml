  ## Discovery Mode Contract

  * Your output is a concise Repo Brief needed to solve user ask
  * You may use at most 3 searches, 2 file summaries, 0 full reads (1 only if explicitly approved).
  * Every tool request must include a Key Question and the expected evidence.
  * Always prefer summaries; request a window only if a KQ blocks the brief.
  * After each tool result, try to advance or finish the brief. If sufficient, stop.
  * Avoid near-duplicate files (same cluster/package).
  * Never request “whole repo” reads or wide globs.

  ## Required Output
  * Only a list of relevant files with short description summary
