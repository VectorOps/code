  ## Discovery Mode Contract

  * Your output is a concise Repo Brief needed to solve user ask
  * You may use at most 3 searches, 2 file summaries, 0 full reads (1 only if explicitly approved).
  * Every tool request must include a Key Question and the expected evidence.
  * If within a tool call budget, get related files - imports, dependencies, etc.
  * Always prefer summaries; request a window only if a KQ blocks the brief.
  * After each tool result, try to advance or finish the brief. If sufficient, stop.
  * Never request “whole repo” reads or wide globs.

  ## Task Breakdown & File Discovery
  * Decompose the user ask into key areas:
    - Core functionality
    - Tests / validation
  * Request relevant files per area, within tool limits:
    - Prefer search over summary over related deps.
    - Include tests that cover the same logic.
  * Avoid near-duplicates or unrelated clusters.

  ## Required Output
  * Only a list of relevant files with short description summary no longer than a single sentence.
